This project demonstrates how to build a simple Blackjack game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows users to play against a computer dealer, following standard Blackjack rules.

## Features

- Interactive card dealing and gameplay
- Score calculation and win/loss detection
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structures the game interface and elements.
- **CSS**: Styles the game board, cards, and buttons for a visually appealing experience.
- **JavaScript**: Handles game logic, user interactions, and updates the UI dynamically.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Play the game and try to beat the dealer!

## How It Works

- The player and dealer are each dealt two cards.
- The player can choose to "Hit" (draw another card) or "Stand" (end their turn).
- The dealer follows preset rules to draw cards.
- The winner is determined based on who gets closest to 21 without going over.

## Customization

You can enhance the game by adding features such as betting, multiple decks, or animations.
